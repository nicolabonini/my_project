my_first project is my first exercise in programming.
I've followed a couple of courses ( this one is an eample 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBDHkveJUf4') I'll use some tutorials
as reference to power my programming skills.

My first idea is to base this first project on Python language, but i could also look ad Java (as of today i have no experience on Java)
and a very limited knowledge on Python. I'm a beginner at programming.


>>>  THE PROJECT  <<<
The idea is to develop a platform/app for clubs to imrpove the process of management tickets' reservation, tables' reservation,
PR's list of attendees, schedule and post events, create/grow/manage a community.


>>>  TECH <<<
The main platform I'll use are:
- Python 3.9.12 (conda interpreter).
- HTML.
- GitHiub: my-project is a public repository.
- PlanetScale: cloud mySQL DB. To evaluate the subscription and pricing available.
- MySQL Workbench: mySQL editor to manage DB.

Others tech topics will be evaluated ongoing.

>>>  DISCLUSURE <<<
The project could be too omplex as first project. I could change purpose and complexity of the project ongoing.
